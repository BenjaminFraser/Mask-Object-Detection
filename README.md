# Mask-Object-Detection


## Introduction

A project that develops a Mask Object detection deep neural network model.

For object detection model development, a Custom pre-trained Faster-RCNN architecture was adapted and fine-tuned to a custom face-mask dataset. Refer to the notebooks within this repository for all code and process(es) applied for this.


## Example predictions

Some basic examples of applying the trained model to new inputs are shown below:
